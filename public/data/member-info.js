      'The Commissioner that started it all. He brought together a group of friends to compete for a prize and created the best group ever. There are those that say he is "crooked" and "it is suspect that he won the championship in the first season", and those people are not neccessarily wrong. Regardless, he is seen as the leader of this ragtag group and does a bang up job each season, even if he is now colluding with the most successful man in the league.',

      "The man with the heart of a champion, but usually the roster of a fringe playoff team. However, he is beloved by all and quite possibly the most athletic guy in this group of 30+ year olds. A member of The Kingdom, his loyalty and selflessness is never overlooked. He may just be the heart and soul of The Kingdom and his drive and will shall take him to a championship in due time.",

      "With his years of experience in life, it seems only a matter of time that the man will win a championship. He has been trending the wrong way recently however, finishing last in the past 2 seasons. But he is a gracious loser, which is another thing that must come with experience. He has shown his prowess in downing waffle after waffle, so it is time to see if that can translate to his drafting and roster this season.",

      "The man on his way to fame and stardom by cohosting Underground Nerd Nation (available on YouTube and maybe anywhere you listen to your favorite podcasts), this man still slums it up with his old friends and brings so much joy and levity to the group. Another member of The Kingdom, he has been inching ever closer to that first championship. With his looks, his love of sports and all things nerdy, some might say he is the perfect man.",

      "Every group needs their attractive, sexy beast, and the AU Trojan League outdid themselves with this specimen. Not only is he the sexiest man alive, but also the nicest and kindest person ever. He deserves so much better than this group, but hopefully he will never realize that. He also has the prestige of having his name on the trophy, despite his love for muscular white men.",

    description: "So many things can be said about this man. For a man that is never prepared for the draft and constantly gets screwed over in trades, it's amazing that he has never come in 10th place. Obviously the 2016 season must have been some sort of fluke. Credit where it is due though, this man is constantly beat down verbally and in almost every matchup, but he keeps coming back for more each season. Also, a very high playoff win percentage, eventhough most of his playoff match ups are in the loser bracket."

      "The era of the Justin's is upon us with the last 5 champions being a Justin, but this is the only Justin that matters. He is the chosen knight and champion of The Kingdom, some may even argue he should be king. He's a smooth operator that knows how to draft and loves to trade. Everyone knows his love of the running back, and many have tried to cripple him by limiting how many he can have.",

      "The word mid was created to describe this man's fantasy career. He is a man that is constantly finishing in the dead middle of the pack every year, aside from a few anomalies. But as it is said, if you want to win a championship playoff, you have to be in it to win it. And one thing this man can say, is he is normally in it. He is a calculated man of many words, and quite possibly the most researched out of us all.",

    description:
      "Fate and destiny are two things this man talks a lot about. But he has a point. Things must obviously be against him since he has not yet won many championships. The self proclaimed Nightmare Prince, he founded The Kingdom to take out the unfairness and collusion in the league. He is leading an unholy crusade as he marches his way to his long overdue championship. (Obviously he's actually just not that good at this and maybe he should consider a trade or 2, but we'll stick with the narrative he's throwing out there for now)",
